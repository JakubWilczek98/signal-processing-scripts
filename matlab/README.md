Lab2:
    - generating basic harmonic signals using matlab build in fcn and step by step
    - saving and reading values from txt and csv files 

Lab3: 
    - generating signals (Sa, exp) using matlab build in fcn and step by step
    - calculating basic signal parameters step by step (f_energia.m, f_min.m, f_max.m, f_sr.m)

Lab4:
